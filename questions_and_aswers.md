1. The answer is A

- => The first variable is 'greeting'. But the second variable is 'greetign' which is a typing mistake. As {} is assigned as the value of 'greetign' and this is what we have console logged, we will get {} as the result.

2. The answer is C

- => sum is a function which takes two parameter, a and b and return a+b. When we have called the function we have given the values as 1 and "2". "2" is string type variable. Adding a int and string type variable has given the answer C.

3. The answer is A

- => The answer will be the initial value of food. Because we have set food[0] as the the value of favoriteFood which is inside info object. As food is an array, each array element holds a reference. Modifying info.favoriteFood does not hamper the initial value.

4. The answer is B

- => sayHi is a function which has an argument named 'name'. It returns Hi there, ${name}. When we called the function, there is no value provided for the argument. That's why we get an undefined and the result is B.

5. The answer is C

- => We have variable named count=0 and an array of 4 items. nums.forEach iterates through each element. The 'if' condition checks whether the value is truthy or falsy. If it's truthy it will increment the count value by 1. As 0 is falsy, no increment happens. 1,2 and 3 are truthy value and so each time count is incremented and we get the result 3.
